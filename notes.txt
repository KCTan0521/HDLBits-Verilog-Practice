// notes: 
// in verilog, you can set Q = Q in always or initial block
// because it means to set the old value of Q to the current Q

// note that initial block is not encouraged to use
// as it is usually not systhesizable in verilog

// $bits()

// it is a good practice to write 4'd10 instead of just plain 10
// because plain 10 will be default to 32-bit

// sometimes when solving problem, can think from the perspective
// like using shifting to solve the problem
// using shifting sometimes can solve problem that require using looping
