// note that the disable for_loop, just disable only the current cycle of loop
// but it does not terminate the for loop, it terminate the current cycle of loop only
// You may have expected disable for_loop; to behave like break; in C, which exits the whole loop.
// But in Verilog, it only exits the named block of that specific iteration.
// disable for_loop; only disables the current iteration's named block. 
// It does not terminate the entire for loop â€” the loop will continue to 
// the next iteration unless additional logic (like a flag) is used
// in other word it is slightly similar continue keyword in programming
// note that disable only can be used in for loop
// continue is loop control, disable is block control (for explanation go chatgpt)
